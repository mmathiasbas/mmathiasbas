### Hi there 👋 I'm Mathias,

I’m a **3rd-year Computer Engineering undergraduate** at the **Universidad Nacional de Trujillo**.

My background focuses on **programming and core computational foundations**, with a solid base in **Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms**, as well as knowledge of **digital systems and computer architecture and organization**. I also have knowledge of **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**, with an emphasis on **data handling and analysis**, and an interest in **Computer Vision** applied to intelligent systems.

I’m interested in **well-structured software development**, the design of **robust technical solutions**, and a deep understanding of the **models and algorithms** behind modern computing systems. My goal is to grow as a developer and engineer by applying **theory and practice** to solve real-world problems.
